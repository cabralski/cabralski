## Hi!

I'm Pedro Cabral. I like computers, calculators, microprocessors, books, hacking, and programming from **High Level Assembly** to **Julia**, **Python**, and **Rust**. Check out my website at [cabral.dev.br](https://cabral.dev.br).

I've worked as a Data Scientist at [Looqbox](https://www.looqbox.com/en), and on [Wolfram Research Inc.](https://wolfram.com) as an Intern Consultant in 2020. I've wrote scientific articles and done data analysis at the Astrophysics and Cosmology Laboratory at [IFCE](https://ifce.edu.br).

I've participated on many academic olympiads (informatics, robotics, mathematics, rockets, and satellites), I have a silver medal at the [Brazillian Satellite Olympiad of 2020](https://obsat.org.br/). I like many topics, ranging from astronomy and astrophysics to philosophy and psychology.

I can code in many languages. My favorite languages are: **C**, **Rust**, **Python**, **Julia**, **Python**, **APL**, **Haskell**, and **Common Lisp**.
