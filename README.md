## Hi!

My name is Pedro Cabral. I'm 19 years old. I code since I was 9 years old (it has been approximately 9 years since then). I'm deeply passionate about computer science, mathematics and philosophy.

I've worked as a Data Scientist at [Looqbox](https://www.looqbox.com/en), and on [Wolfram Research Inc.](https://wolfram.com) as an Intern Consultant in 2020. I've wrote scientific articles and done data analysis at the Astrophysics and Cosmology Laboratory at [IFCE](https://ifce.edu.br).

I've participated on many academic olympiads (informatics, robotics, mathematics, rockets, and satellites), I have a silver medal at the [Brazillian Satellite Olympiad of 2020](https://obsat.org.br/). I like many topics, ranging from astronomy and astrophysics to philosophy and psychology.
