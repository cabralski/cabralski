👋🏻 Hi! My name is **Pedro Cabral**. I'm 19 years old. 👋🏻

I code since I was **9 years old** (it has been approximately 9 years since then).

I've previously worked as a **Data Scientist** at [Looqbox](https://www.looqbox.com/en), and as an as an **Intern Consultant** at [Wolfram Research](https://wolfram.com). I've wrote scientific articles and done data analysis at the *Astrophysics and Cosmology Laboratory* at [IFCE](https://ifce.edu.br).

I've participated on many academic olympiads (informatics, robotics, mathematics, rockets, and satellites), here are some of my medals:
- 🥇 **Best Robot Programming** - [Brazillian Robotics Olympiad of 2019](http://www.obr.org.br/)
- 🥈 **Silver Medal** - [Brazillian Satellite Olympiad of 2020](https://obsat.org.br/)
- 🥉 **Honor to Merit** - [Brazillian Informatics Olympiad of 2017](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br/)

Currently, these are all of my **"Staff Picks"** articles in the [Wolfram Community](https://community.wolfram.com/web/pedrogcabral):
